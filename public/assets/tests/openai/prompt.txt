GPT-4o (OpenAI)
"Create an image of a fighting game character named GPT-4o, designed as a selectable fighter in the style of Tekken 4's character selection menu. The character captures the early 2000s PS2 look—sharp, blocky polygons, realistic yet stylized textures, and a muted palette with a modern twist. GPT-4o is a sleek, agile martial artist with a lean build, wearing a minimalist outfit in a modern OpenAI style: a smooth, dark gray gi with subtle light blue accents along the edges and a faint, glowing blue circuit pattern on the chest. His cropped jacket is dark gray with light blue piping, paired with slim pants and sleek combat boots. His hands sport fingerless gloves, and he stands in a precise, coiled stance—one fist raised, the other near his waist—radiating focus. His face is sharp with a subtle smirk, topped with short, spiked black hair with a hint of blue highlights. The background is the Tekken 4 selection screen: a dark, industrial void with faint hexagonal patterns and a glowing nameplate below reading 'GPT-4o' in bold, white Tekken font with a red outline. A faint blue digital shimmer surrounds him, tying his modern OpenAI vibe to the gritty Tekken 4 tone."

A bold orange slash runs diagonally across his chest, symbolizing his identity. His hands are wrapped in weathered bandages, and he stands in a loose, taunting stance—arms bent, one hand open—exuding sly confidence. His face is angular with a cunning grin, framed by messy, sandy-brown hair with a faint orange tint. The background is the Tekken 4 selection screen: a dark, industrial void with faint hexagonal patterns and a glowing nameplate below reading 'Claude' in bold, white Tekken font with a red outline. A soft swirl of orange dust trails around him, grounding his scrappy style in the raw Tekken 4 energy."
