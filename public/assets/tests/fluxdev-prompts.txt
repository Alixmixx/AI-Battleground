GPT-4o
"Create an image of a fighting game character named GPT-4o, designed as a selectable fighter in the style of Tekken 4's character selection menu. The character reflects the early 2000s PS2 look—sharp, slightly blocky polygons, realistic yet stylized textures, and a muted color palette with a gritty edge. GPT-4o is a sleek, futuristic martial artist with a lean, agile frame, clad in a black gi with glowing cyan circuitry patterns tracing the seams, paired with a cropped jacket featuring angular shoulder pads and sturdy combat boots with metallic accents. His hands sport fingerless gloves, and he stands in a coiled, ready-to-strike pose—one fist raised, the other near his waist—exuding precision and intensity. His sharp face carries a subtle smirk, with short, spiked jet-black hair streaked with electric blue. The background is the Tekken 4 selection screen: a dark, industrial void with faint hexagonal patterns and a glowing nameplate below reading 'GPT-4o' in bold, white Tekken font with a red outline. A faint digital static aura surrounds him, hinting at his AI origins, seamlessly blending with the urban Tekken 4 vibe."

Claude
"Create an image of a fighting game character named Claude, designed as a selectable fighter in the style of Tekken 4's character selection menu. The character captures the early 2000s PS2 aesthetic—sharp polygons, slightly grainy textures, and a muted, realistic color scheme. Claude is a wiry, tactical brawler with a lean build, dressed in a rugged, earth-toned outfit: a sleeveless brown vest with subtle stitching, dark cargo pants with worn patches, and heavy boots scuffed from battle. His hands are wrapped in weathered bandages, and he stands in a loose, deceptive stance—arms slightly bent, one hand open as if taunting—radiating calm confidence. His face is angular with a sly grin, topped with messy, sandy-brown hair tied back loosely. The background mimics the Tekken 4 selection screen: a shadowy, industrial void with faint hexagonal patterns and a glowing nameplate below reading 'Claude' in bold, white Tekken font with a red outline. A soft haze of dust swirls around him, suggesting his grounded, scrappy fighting style, perfectly in tune with Tekken 4’s raw energy."

Grok
"Create an image of a fighting game character named Grok, designed as a selectable fighter in the style of Tekken 4's character selection menu. The character embodies the early 2000s PS2 visual style—sharp, blocky polygons, realistic yet stylized textures, and a muted palette with a gritty finish. Grok is a sturdy, cosmic-inspired fighter with a muscular build, wearing a dark blue gi with faint star-like speckles across the chest, paired with a tattered, flowing scarf and black pants with silver streaks resembling comet tails. His fists are clad in reinforced gauntlets, and he stands in a bold, wide stance—knees bent, fists clenched—projecting raw power and curiosity. His face is rugged with a determined glare, framed by wild, silver-streaked black hair. The background is the Tekken 4 selection screen: a dark, industrial void with faint hexagonal patterns and a glowing nameplate below reading 'Grok' in bold, white Tekken font with a red outline. A subtle shimmer of cosmic dust trails around him, tying his extraterrestrial vibe to the gritty Tekken 4 atmosphere."

Gemini
"Create an image of a fighting game character named Gemini, designed as a selectable fighter in the style of Tekken 4's character selection menu. The character reflects the early 2000s PS2 aesthetic—sharp polygons, slightly grainy textures, and a muted, realistic color palette with a rough edge. Gemini is a duality-themed martial artist with an athletic build, dressed in a split-color outfit: one side red with jagged flame patterns, the other black with sleek, angular lines, merging into a asymmetrical jacket and tight pants with mismatched boots. His hands wear one red glove and one black glove, and he stands in a mirrored stance—left arm forward, right arm back—exuding balance and tension. His face is intense with a split expression (half-smirk, half-scowl), and his hair is two-toned: red on one side, black on the other, swept back sharply. The background is the Tekken 4 selection screen: a dark, industrial void with faint hexagonal patterns and a glowing nameplate below reading 'Gemini' in bold, white Tekken font with a red outline. A faint ripple of energy splits around him, reflecting his dual nature within the raw Tekken 4 style."
